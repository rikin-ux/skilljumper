SkillJumper is an adaptive quest-based platform that empowers neurodivergent young people (aged 11-25) to develop independence through personalized, bite-sized challenges called "SkillJumps." Our platform uses advanced algorithmic personalization to deliver contextually appropriate tasks that build real-world skills while respecting individual learning differences.

## 🧠 The Science Behind SkillJumper

Our core innovation is the **Adaptive Quest Selection Algorithm** - a sophisticated AI system that personalizes learning experiences based on:

- **Neurodivergent Learning Profiles**: ADHD, autism, dyslexia, and other learning differences
- **Real-time Context**: Energy levels, environment, available time, and emotional state  
- **Progressive Skill Building**: Adaptive difficulty with scaffolded support
- **Evidence-based Interventions**: Grounded in occupational therapy and educational research

## 🎯 Key Features

### For Young People
- **Personalized SkillJumps**: Contextually appropriate micro-challenges
- **Adaptive Difficulty**: Algorithm adjusts based on performance and feedback
- **Multi-modal Support**: Visual, auditory, and kinesthetic learning options
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual representations of skill development
- **Offline Capability**: Core functionality works without internet

### For Families & Supporters
- **Progress Insights**: Understand skill development patterns
- **Customizable Support**: Adjust assistance levels and notification preferences
- **Safety Features**: Built-in safeguarding and emergency protocols
- **Guardian Dashboard**: Monitor without being intrusive

### For Practitioners
- **Clinical Integration**: Export progress data for therapy sessions
- **Evidence Collection**: Track outcomes for interventions
- **Customizable Frameworks**: Adapt to different therapeutic approaches

## 🔬 Algorithm Architecture

Our **Adaptive Quest Selection Algorithm** implements a 5-stage pipeline:

1. **Intent Analysis**: Natural language processing of user context
2. **Candidate Filtering**: Multi-criteria quest eligibility assessment  
3. **Contextual Scoring**: Real-time personalization scoring (0-100)
4. **Quest Adaptation**: Dynamic difficulty and support modifications
5. **Recommendation Generation**: Comprehensive success prediction and support planning

### Technical Highlights

```typescript
// Example algorithm usage
const questSystem = new SkillJumperQuestSystem();

const recommendation = await questSystem.recommendQuest({
  user: userProfile,
  context: currentContext,
  preferences: userPreferences,
  constraints: timeAndLocation
});

// Process feedback for continuous learning
await questSystem.processFeedback(
  questId, 
  outcome, 
  userFeedback, 
  adaptationsUsed
);
```

**Key Algorithm Features:**
- **Machine Learning Integration**: User model updates from feedback loops
- **Risk Assessment**: Comprehensive safety evaluation for each recommendation
- **Fallback Strategies**: Multiple options when primary recommendation fails
- **Privacy-First**: All processing happens locally, no personal data transmitted

## 📊 Research & Evidence

SkillJumper is built on solid research foundations:

- **Occupational Therapy**: Task analysis and graded challenge principles
- **Educational Psychology**: Zone of proximal development and scaffolding
- **Neurodiversity Research**: Strengths-based approaches to learning differences
- **Digital Health**: Evidence-based mobile health intervention design

### Planned Research Studies
- Pilot study with 50 participants (Q4 2025)

    await getQuestRecommendation({
      user: currentUser,
      context: getCurrentContext(),
      preferences: userPreferences
    });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleGetQuest} disabled={isLoading}>
        Get My Next SkillJump
      </button>
      {recommendation && (
        <QuestCard quest={recommendation.quest} />
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```
